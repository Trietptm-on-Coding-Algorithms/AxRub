AxRub is an ActiveX fuzzer written in Ruby. AxRub was first introduced at Blackhat 2009
during the 'Ruby For Pentesters' talk given by Chris Rohlf, Eric Monti and Mike Tracy.

AxRub is simple. Give it a ProgID and it uses win32ole to parse the methods and properties
of an ActiveX component. It sets up a fake web server and generates the proper HTML and JS
to fuzz the methods of that ActiveX component. Just launch your browser, attach a debugger
and browse to the port AxRub uses.
